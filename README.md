The Fxp Block provides tools for defining UI blocks, rendering and mapping
response data to related models. This library can easily create user interface elements,
and render the fields of an object in the locale/currency desired. It was intended as a
basis for designing elements of user interface, such as, panel, navbar, sidebar, data
table/grid, etc...

It was largely inspired by the [Symfony Form](https://github.com/symfony/form) in all
the features available in this library.

- Block Registry
- Block Factory

- Templating Engine
- Block Renderer
