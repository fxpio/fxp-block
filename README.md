The Sonatra Block provides tools for defining UI blocks, rendering and mapping
response data to related models. This library can easily create user interface elements,
and render the fields of an object in the locale/currency desired. It was intended as a
basis for designing elements of user interface, such as, panel, navbar, sidebar, data
table/grid, etc...

It was largely inspired by the [Symfony Form](https://github.com/symfony/form) in all
the features available in this library.

Features include:

- Block Registry
- Block Factory
- Block Type Builder
- Block Type Configuration
- Block Type Extension
- Data Mapper
- Data Transformer
- All same default Form Types
- Automatic type detection
- Templating Engine
- Block Renderer
- Twig Renderer Engine
- Twig Extension
- Block Theme and hierarchy for search parent block
- Doctrine Entity Type
- Twig filter formatter for convert the value in the specific block type
- Profiler
