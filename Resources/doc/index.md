## Installation

### Download the library using composer

Add Sonatra Block in your composer.json:

```js
{
    "require": {
        "sonatra/block": "~1.0"
    }
}
```

Or tell composer to download the library by running the command:

```bash
$ php composer.phar require sonatra/block:"~1.0"
```

Composer will install the library to your project's `vendor/sonatra` directory.
